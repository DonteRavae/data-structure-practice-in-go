# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN GOLANG

I wanted to take what I learned in my Data Structure and Algorithm class (Algorithmic Design) and apply it to the Go programming language. The class is taught using Java. *Go* at the moment doesn't have support for Generics so I'm implementing the data structures using integers. For the binary tree and heaps, I'm using integers to bypass using a Comparable interface like I would in Java.

## Data Structures Implemented
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Tree
- Tries*

## Data Structures To Be Implemented
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Tries (Already implemented after following a YouTube video but will re-implement once I get a better understanding)
